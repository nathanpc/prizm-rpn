# RPN Casio Prizm Add-In

A add-in to transform your Casio Prizm into a much more powerful calculator.


## Requirements

Since there isn't a standard math library included with [libfxcg](https://github.com/Jonimoose/libfxcg) you'll either have to add [FDLIBM](http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/) yourself or you could just use my fork of libfxcg located [*here*](https://github.com/nathanpc/libfxcg) which has the latest version of everything you might need.
